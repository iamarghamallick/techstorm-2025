    description: "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. Code-Bee is an offline coding event which tests your logical, mathematical and basic programming skills. Plunge in to unravel the deep Coding secrets and swim up to the shore with the best algorithm.",
